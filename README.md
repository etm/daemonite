## Introduction

Deamonite is just syntactic sugar around Process.daemon and argparse, which are
part of standard ruby. An it only works on Linux because it runs 'ps ax'. I
know, thats clumsy and doesn't run on windows. Please contribute a better
solution if you have to.

## Usage

Its fairly simple for now:

```ruby
Daemonite.new do |opts|
  opts['bla']

  run do |opts|
    p opts
    sleep 1
  end
end.loop!
```

Everything inside the #new block is executed once. Everything inside the #run
block is executed periodically. So make sure to include sleep to not bog down
your CPU. #loop! finally starts a periodical loop.

In order to override options, or provide your own options at start:

```ruby
Daemonite.new(opts)
```

Also be aware that a json configuration file $PROGRAM_NAME.sub /\.rb$/, '.conf'
is automatically read, if it exists.

## Usage - Alternative

```ruby
daemon = Daemonite.new(opts)
daemon.run do |opts|
  p opts
  sleep 1
end
daemon.loop!
```

## TODO

1. An example how to integrate with EventMachine (replace the #loop!).
