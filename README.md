## Introduction

Deamonite is just syntactic sugar around Process.daemon and argparse, which are
part of ruby. And it gives you a simple loop. And it only works on
*nix, because it runs 'ps ax' (that rhymes). I know, thats clumsy and I'm a lazy
git. Please contribute a better solution if you have to.

## Why

After I reused similar code in about 20 projects I had make it into a gem.
Sorry. Probably much better code out there does the same, but I am too lazy to
search for it. Sorry.

## Usage

Its fairly simple for now:

```ruby
Daemonite.new do |opts|
  opts['bla']

  run do |opts|
    p opts
    sleep 1
  end
end.loop!
```

Everything inside the #new block is executed once. Everything inside the #run
block is executed periodically. So make sure to include sleep to not bog down
your CPU. Or not - i.e. listen to network connections. #loop! finally invokes the
contents of #run continuously.

In order to override or provide your own options:

```ruby
Daemonite.new(opts)
```

Also be aware that a json configuration file $PROGRAM_NAME.sub /\.rb$/, '.conf'
is automatically read, if it exists.

## Usage - Sinatra

Give PID file + daemon start, stop, restart, info functionality to sinatra. Stack overflow overflows with questions about it :-)

```ruby
require 'sinatra/base'
require 'daemonite'
                                                                                                                               
Daemonite.new do |opts|
  on startup do
    opts[:sin] = Sinatra.new do
      set :port, 9327
      Encoding.default_external = "UTF-8"

      get '/' do
        'Hello world!'
      end
    end
  end
  
  run do
    opts[:sin].run!
  end
end.go!
```

## Usage - Alternative

```ruby
daemon = Daemonite.new(opts)
daemon.run do |opts|
  p opts
  sleep 1
end
daemon.loop!
```

## TODO

1. An example how to integrate with EventMachine (replace the #loop!).
